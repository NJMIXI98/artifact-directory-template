Title:
<Auditing race and gender inequality in data science related job market>

Abstract:
<In the twentieth century, one of sociology’s findings is that race and gender matter in the job market. Jobs were segregated by race and gender with whites earning more than other people of color and men earning more than women. Race inequality in the job market has been a long-standing interest of scholars. Notably, some research indicates that racial gaps are more significant for women than for men. Women face the unique challenges of lower wages and lower rewards in the global workforce. However, as women’s relative share in occupations grows nowadays, the gender inequality gap narrows in most job markets(Stier et al.,2014). Besides, a finding shows that race-based discrimination is weaker in high-paid jobs. Back in 2012, the Harvard Business Review acclaimed data science as “the sexiest job of the 21st century”. Some may pose the question of whether the statement still holds today. According to the U.S. BUREAU of Labor Statistics, employment in data science is projected to grow 36% from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations, which means employers will create more than 13,500 new data science related job opportunities each year on average, over the decade(Bureau of Labor Statistics 2022). Thus, we are curious about gender-based and race-based inequality in data science.>
